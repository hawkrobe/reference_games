<h2><center>Matching Game</center>  </h2>

	<p> 

    In this experiment you will play a fun matching game with another turker! Both of you are going to be given a set of tangram pictures which will look like this. 
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/tangramBoard.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    You'll each have the same 12 images but the order they are in will be different. 

</p>

  <p>
    One of you will be assigned the <b> Speaker </b> role and the
    other will be the <b> Listener</b>. On each round, one of the
    twelve objects is marked as the target, which can be identified by a <b>
    black box</b> around it. Only the speaker can see which object is
    the target. The task of the speaker is to tell the listener which
    one of the objects is the target and the listener in turn needs to
    select the right object based on this information. You'll both
    get <b> a bonus of $0.01 for each correct response</b>, so pay
    attention! Remember that it doesn't make sense to describe the
    location of the target object, since the order of the images is
    different for the listener and the speaker.
</p>

    <p>
      <center><img src="images/chatBox.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:700px;height:400px"></center>
    </p>

    <p>
    Thus, the goal is for the listener to identify the correct color
    based on what the speaker has said. In order to communicate,
    you're given a chatbox where you can send messages back and forth
    to each other. The speaker can say whatever they need to indicate
    which color is the target (this isn't a game of "taboo"!), and the
    listener can respond or ask questions at any point. Some rounds
    will be easier and some will be harder. </p>

    <p> Once the speaker sends a message and the listener clicks on
    the object they believe is the target, both players will be given
    feedback (the speaker will see what the listener clicked, and the
    listener will see the true target), and you will both be
    automatically forwarded to the next round of objects. There are a
    total of <b>50 rounds</b>. After the final round you will fill out a quick
    15 second survey and be on your way. You're welcome to accept another HIT and play again.
</p>

<p>
    
  You won't get feedback on how many images you have correct while you are playing the round, but after each round ends you will be told your score from the previous round. 
</p>

<p>
  If this task isn't fun enough already (which we think it is) you and your teammate will individually be rewarded 1 cent for every correctly matching images you finish a round with. This means you and your partner each have the chance to earn up to 12 BONUS CENTS per round for each of the 6 rounds. 
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned above, there are a total of 6 rounds. At the start of each round, you and your teammates images  will be shuffled again. After the sixth round you will fill out a quick 15 second survey and be on your way. 
</p>

<p> Two final notes: Since you are playing with another turker, you may see this screen before the game begins. 
      <p>
      <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:700px;height:150px"></center>
    </p>

Just hold tight. Another turker should join the game within the next few minutes; if you're still waiting after 15 minutes have passed, your HIT will automatically submit and you will be compensated the full amount for your time.
</p>

<p> Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in and you and your partner may not be able to submit the HIT. Thank you! 
</p>
