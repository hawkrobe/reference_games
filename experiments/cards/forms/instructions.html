<h2><center>The color matching game!</center>  </h2>

	<p> 

	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game with
	  another turker! In each round both of you are going to be given a set of
	  colors which will look like this:
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/colorSet.png" alt="Example objects" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    You'll each see the same 3 colors <b> but the order they are in
	will be different. </b>

</p>

<p>

    One of you will be assigned the <b> Speaker </b> role and the
    other will be the <b> Listener</b>. On each round, one of the
    three objects is the target, which can be identified by a <b>
    black box</b> around it. Only the speaker can see which object is
    the target. The task of the speaker is to tell the listener which
    one of the objects is the target and the listener in turn needs to
    select the right object based on this information. You'll both
    get <b> a bonus of $0.01 for each correct response</b>, so pay
    attention! Remember that it doesn't make sense to describe the
    location of the target object, since the order of the images is
    different for the listener and the speaker.
</p>

<p>
      <center><img src="images/speakerView.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:328px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
  <i> <center> <small> Only the speaker can see that the reddish/pinkish square is the target. </small> </center> </i>

</p>
<p>
    Thus, the goal is for the listener to identify the correct color
    based on what the speaker has said. In order to communicate,
    you're given a chatbox where you can send messages back and forth
    to each other. The speaker can say whatever they need to indicate
    which color is the target (this isn't a game of "taboo"!), and the
    listener can respond or ask questions at any point. Some rounds
    will be easier and some will be harder. </p>

    <p> Once the speaker sends a message and the listener clicks on
    the object they believe is the target, both players will be given
    feedback (the speaker will see what the listener clicked, and the
    listener will see the true target), and you will both be
    automatically forwarded to the next round of objects. There are a
    total of <b>50 rounds</b>. After the final round you will fill out a quick
    15 second survey and be on your way. You're welcome to accept another HIT and play again.
</p>
    
<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with another
  turker, you may see this screen before the game begins:
  <p>
    <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:700px;height:150px"></center>
  </p>
  Just hold tight. Another turker should join the game within the next
  few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes without
  another player joining, your HIT will automatically be submitted and
  accepted, out of gratitude for the time you spent waiting.
</p>

<p>
  Second, please be respectful of the turker you're playing with: do
  not send inappropriate material through the chat box (including
  screenshots of the color you're trying to refer to), and try to be as
  responsive as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Third, because differences between colors can be quite subtle and
  difficult to describe, it is important that you and your partner are
  seeing the same thing. Turn your brightness up all the way, and turn
  off any software (like f.lux or redshift) that changes the colors on
  your monitor!
</p>

<p>
  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start
  the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not
  be able to rejoin the game you were in and you may not be able to
  submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
</p>
