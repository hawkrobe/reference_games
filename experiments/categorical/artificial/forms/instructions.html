	<h2><center>Guess My Object!</center>  </h2>

	<p>
	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game
	  with another turker! In this experiment, you will encounter
	  eight objects:
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/all_objs.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:642px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  One of you will be assigned the <b> Speaker </b> role and
	  the other will be the <b> Listener </b>. On each round, we
	  will pick four of these eight objects and show them to both
	  of you. The objects will be shown in different orders on your
	  different screens. One of the four is the <b>target</b>, which is
	  outlined in black. Only the Speaker can see which object is
	  the target. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/screenshot_objs.png" alt="Example objects"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>

	<p>
	  The goal of the Speaker is to send a message so that the
	  Listener can figure out which object is the target. You'll both
	  get <b> a bonus of $0.03 for each correct response</b>, so
	  pay attention!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The goal of the Listener is to identify the target
	  based on what the Speaker has told you. If you are the Listener,
	  you will first need to wait until the Speaker has sent their
	  message before being able to select an object.
	</p>

	<p>
	  What makes this game more interesting and challenging is the
	  content of your messages: instead of using the English
	  language, you get to make up a language together! Both you
	  and your partner will see an array of nine messages that
	  could be part of this language: to send one of the messages,
	  the Speaker can click and drag it into the grey 'dropzone'
	  below. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <center>
	    <img src="images/screenshot_labels.png" alt="Example labels"
		 style="width:300px; height:300px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Once the Listener clicks on the object they believe is the
	  target, both players will be given feedback: the Speaker
	  will see what the Listener clicked, and the Listener will
	  see the true target. Then you will both automatically
	  advance to the next round of objects and <b>switch roles</b>, so
	  the Listener will become the Speaker and vice versa. There
	  are a total of <b>60 rounds</b>. After the final round you
	  will fill out a quick 15 second survey and be on your way.
	</p>

	<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with
	  another player, you may see this screen before the game
	  begins:
	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board"
		       style="width:700px;height:150px">
	  </center>
	</p>
	Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within
	the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
	without another player joining, please email us to let us know
	(rxdh@stanford.edu).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
	  with: pay close attention and try to be as responsive as
	  possible. Please do not take notes -- just use your mind!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
	  you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
	  refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
	  and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
	</p>
