<h2><center>The shape matching game!</center>  </h2>

	<p> 

	  In this experiment you will play a fun communication game with
	  another turker! In each round both of you are going to be given a set of
	  loopy shapes which will look like this:
</p>
    <p>
      <center><img src="images/shapesScreenshot.png" alt="Example objects" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    You'll each see the same 3 shapes <b> but the order
	will be different. </b>

</p>

<p>

    One of you will be assigned the <b> Speaker </b> role and the other will be
    the <b> Listener </b>. For each round, one of the three objects is the target, which
    can be identified by a <b> black box</b> around it. Only the speaker can see which object is the target. The task of the speaker
    is to tell the listener which one of the objects is the target and the listener in turn needs to select the right
    object based on this information provided by the speaker. Remember that it doesn't make sense to describe the location of the target object, since the order of the images is different for the listener and the speaker.
</p>

<p>
      <center><img src="images/shapesFromSpeaker.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:360px"></center>
    </p>
<p>
    <i> <center> <small> Only the speaker can see which one is the target. </small> </center> </i>

</p>
<p>
  The task of the listener to identify the correct color based on
    what the speaker has said. In order to communicate, you're given a
    chatbox where you can send messages back and forth to each
    other. The speaker can say whatever they need to indicate which
    shape is the target, and the listener is free to ask for
    clarifications if what the speaker said is not clear. Some rounds
    will be easier and some will be harder. </p>

    <p> Once the speaker sends a message and the listener clicks on
    the object they believe is the target, both players will be <b>
    given feedback </b> (the speaker will see what the listener
    clicked, and the listener will see the true target), and you will
    both be automatically forwarded to the next round of objects. You
    will <b>both</b> get a 1 cent bonus for each round where the listener
    correctly identifies the target, for a total of <b>50
    rounds</b>. After the final round you will fill out a quick 15
    second survey and be on your way.
</p>
    
<p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with another
  turker, you may see this screen before the game begins:
  <p>
    <center><img src="images/waitScreen.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:700px;height:150px"></center>
  </p>
  Just hold tight. Another turker should join the game within the next
  few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes without
  another player joining, your HIT will automatically be submitted and
  accepted, out of gratitude for the time you spent waiting.
</p>

<p> Second, please be respectful of the turker you're playing with:
  they're real people, so do not send rude or inappropriate material
  through the chat box (including links or screenshots), and try to be
  as fast and responsive as possible to respect your partner's time:
  it can be very frustrating if your partner suddenly disappears and
  makes the task longer than anticipated. If your partner disconnects
  in the middle of the game, you will be sent to the survey and
  allowed to submit the HIT for full compensation.
</p>

<p> Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you
  start the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you
  will not be able to rejoin the game you were in and you may not be
  able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
</p>
